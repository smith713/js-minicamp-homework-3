Feynman Writing Prompts

* Objects - a collection of properties
* Properties - the association between a key and a value
* Methods - functions in a object
* for in loop - loops through the properties of an object
* dot notation vs bracket notation - bracket notation does the same as dot   notation but it can use variables. Both are used to access properties in an   object.
